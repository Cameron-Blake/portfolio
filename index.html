    <h2 class="title" >About Me</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I am new to coding and have only just been introduced. I graduated High School and was actually thinking of goin into Engineering not coding. As of right now I have a little of experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript with very little exposure to Node.Js. While I was in High School I played Soccer and if it wasn't for tearing my ACL my junior season I could have gone to college and played, I wasn't D1 material but a smaller college wasn't out of the books. On my off days from class I competetively play fps games and try to stream, becoming the next Ninja wouldn't be too bad in my opinion.</p>
